# Heart-Study-Analysis

This project looks at the Framingham Heart Study data set as found on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset).\\

The purpose of this project is to build a model in R that most accurately predict whether a person will have heart disease in Ten Years. I will use classification methods, described further below, with a special focus on Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
