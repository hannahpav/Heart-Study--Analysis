# Heart-Study-Analysis

This project looks at the [Framingham Heart Study data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aasheesh200/framingham-heart-study-dataset) set as found on kaggle.

The purpose of this project is to build a model in R that most accurately predict whether a person will have heart disease in Ten Years. I will use classification methods, described further below, with a special focus on Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
